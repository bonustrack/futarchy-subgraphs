▌ Whoops, the AssemblyScript compiler has crashed during compile :-(

▌ Here is the stack trace hinting at the problem, perhaps it's useful?

▌ If it refers to the dist files, try to 'npm install source-map-support' and
▌ run again, which should then show the actual code location in the sources.
▌ 
▌ If you see where the error is, feel free to send us a pull request. If not,
▌ please let us know: https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript/issues

▌ Thank you!

Suggestion: try to comment the whole file and uncomment it little by little while re-running the graph-cli until you isolate the line where the problem happens.
Also, please contact us so we can make the CLI better by handling errors like this. You can reach out in any of these links:
